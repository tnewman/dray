# ðŸšš Dray ðŸšš
A cloud native SFTP server designed to support multiple data storage backends, starting with S3.

## Why?
Many enterprise applications, such as ADP, SAP, and Workday, are used within companies as a source of truth for their data. These applications offer automated SFTP uploads to synchronize data with other applications. In short, applications that want to interface with enterprise data need to support SFTP.

Dray aims to tackle the undifferentiated heavy lifting of handling SFTP integrations, so developers can focus on differentiating their product.

## What's With the Name
A dray is a cart used to transport heavy cargo short distances. Dray transports files of any size to the storage backend.

## Hacking
### Prerequisites
- [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- cd to the `dray` repository
- Generate an SSH keypair in the `dray` directory (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f .ssh/id_ed25519`)

### Test, Build, and Run
- Start Containers (`docker-compose up`)
- Run Tests (`cargo test`)
- Run Dray (`cargo run`)

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This project is currently not in a usable state. The project will be considered usable when 
the MVP roadmap has been implemented.
